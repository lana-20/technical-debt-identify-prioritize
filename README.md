# Identify and Prioritize Technical Debt

### Why is Technical Debt a Concern?
The consequences of technical debt can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. Technical debt can slow down the delivery of future releases or sprint increments, make it more difficult to find and fix defects, and erode good testing practices. These factors can result in increased costs and decreased productivity.

Therefore, it's important to be aware of technical debt and take steps to manage it effectively to ensure the long-term success of a software development project.

While teams within large organizations often inherent substantial amounts of technical debt from legacy systems, they struggle on reaching agreement on what technical debt *is* and which aspects of their systems they should focus on improving. This post outlines how distributed teams can collaborate at scale to identify and prioritize technical debt.
